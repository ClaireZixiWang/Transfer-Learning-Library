class MaxOverlapMatcher(object):
    """
    This class assigns to each predicted "element" (e.g., a box) a ground-truth
    element. Each predicted element will have exactly zero or one matches; each
    ground-truth element may be matched to zero or more predicted elements.

    The matching is determined by the MxN match_quality_matrix, that characterizes
    how well each (ground-truth, prediction)-pair match each other. For example,
    if the elements are boxes, this matrix may contain box intersection-over-union
    overlap values.

    The matcher returns (a) a vector of length N containing the index of the
    ground-truth element m in [0, M) that matches to prediction n in [0, N).
    (b) a vector of length N containing the labels for each prediction.

        Args:
            thresholds (list): a list of thresholds used to stratify predictions
                into levels.
            labels (list): a list of values to label predictions belonging at
                each level. A label can be one of {-1, 0, 1} signifying
                {ignore, negative class, positive class}, respectively.

            For example,
                thresholds = [0.3, 0.5]
                labels = [0, -1, 1]
                All predictions with iou < 0.3 will be marked with 0 and
                thus will be considered as false positives while training.
                All predictions with 0.3 <= iou < 0.5 will be marked with -1 and
                thus will be ignored.
                All predictions with 0.5 <= iou will be marked with 1 and
                thus will be considered as true positives.
